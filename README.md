# SentimentAI — Product Features & Capabilities

### A Complete Overview of What SentimentAI Offers

---

## 1. Introduction

SentimentAI is an end-to-end, AI-powered customer experience platform built to solve one of the biggest blind spots in modern customer support: businesses cannot see, in real time, how their customers actually feel. Support teams read words — SentimentAI reads emotion.

Every message a customer sends, whether typed, spoken, or emailed, is analyzed instantly. The system understands not just *what* the customer said, but *how* they feel and *what should happen next* — and it acts on that understanding automatically, without waiting for a human to notice.

This document describes, in full detail, every feature the platform provides and the practical business value each one delivers.

## 2. Core Intelligence Engine

### 2.1 Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
Every customer message is scored on a continuous scale from 0.0 (extremely negative) to 1.0 (extremely positive), along with a specific emotion label such as *angry*, *frustrated*, *neutral*, *happy*, or *grateful*. This analysis happens in under one second, powered by Groq's LLaMA 3.3 70B model.

**Business value:** Support teams no longer have to guess which conversations need urgent attention. The system tells them, instantly and objectively.

### 2.2 Automatic Action Routing
Based on the sentiment score, the platform automatically decides one of three actions:
- **Escalate** — the customer is frustrated or angry and needs a human agent immediately.
- **Normal** — the interaction is routine and can be handled by the AI.
- **Upsell** — the customer is satisfied, representing an ideal moment to offer additional value.

**Business value:** No conversation is ever left unattended, and no revenue opportunity is missed simply because no one was watching.

### 2.3 Context-Aware AI Replies
The AI does not use generic, scripted responses. Every reply is generated fresh, based on the customer's actual message, their emotional state, and the intended action (empathetic for escalation, helpful for normal queries, or persuasive for upsell moments). Replies are generated fluently in Hindi, English, or Hinglish, matching the customer's own language and tone.

**Business value:** Customers feel heard by a system that responds appropriately to their mood, not a robotic script.

### 2.4 Persistent Conversation Memory
The system remembers customers across sessions. If a returning customer mentions their name, a past issue, or a preference, that information is stored and recalled automatically in future conversations — the AI can greet a returning customer by name and reference prior interactions.

**Business value:** Customers are never forced to repeat themselves. The experience feels continuous and personal, similar to speaking with a familiar support agent.

## 3. Communication Channels

### 3.1 Live Chat
A real-time, WebSocket-powered chat interface where every message is analyzed the instant it is sent. The customer sees an immediate AI reply; the underlying sentiment score, emotion, and recommended action are all tracked and displayed live on the dashboard.

**Business value:** Instant, always-on support with zero wait time for AI-handled queries.

### 3.2 Voice Support
Customers can speak instead of type. Audio is transcribed to text using Groq's Whisper model, analyzed for sentiment exactly like a text message, and the AI's reply can be spoken back aloud using text-to-speech. This works in both Hindi and English.

**Business value:** Extends support accessibility to customers who prefer speaking, and captures emotional nuance (tone of voice) that text alone may not convey clearly.

### 3.3 Email Integration
The platform connects directly to a business's support inbox via IMAP/SMTP. It automatically checks for new emails, analyzes their sentiment, generates an appropriate reply, and can send that reply back to the customer — either automatically or after human review. High-frustration emails automatically generate support tickets.

**Business value:** Email support, historically the slowest support channel, becomes as fast and intelligent as live chat.

## 4. Support Operations

### 4.1 Automated Ticketing System
When a conversation is escalated, a ticket is automatically created — no manual entry required. Tickets are automatically assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low) based on the sentiment score of the triggering message, and can be tracked from creation through resolution.

**Business value:** Nothing falls through the cracks. Every urgent issue becomes a trackable, prioritized ticket the moment it's detected — automatically.

### 4.2 Agent Console & Human Handoff
When a customer needs a human agent, the system doesn't just alert someone — it manages the full handoff. It maintains a live queue of pending conversations sorted by priority, matches each conversation to the most appropriate available agent (based on specialization and current workload), and hands over full conversation history and context so the agent never starts from scratch.

Agents have their own console showing:
- A live queue of incoming, unassigned conversations
- Their own active conversations with full chat history
- A directory of all agents with real-time status (online, busy, offline)
- Complete handoff history with resolution outcomes and customer ratings

**Business value:** Human agents are used exactly where they add the most value — high-emotion conversations — and are never overloaded, since the system manages routing and workload automatically.

### 4.3 Knowledge Base
A searchable library of frequently asked questions and answers. When a customer asks a question, the system first checks whether a high-confidence answer already exists in the knowledge base before generating a new AI response, ensuring consistency for common queries. New FAQ entries can be added at any time, and usage is tracked so the business can see which answers are used most.

**Business value:** Reduces repetitive AI generation costs and response time for common questions, while keeping answers consistent and on-brand.

## 5. Business Intelligence & Analytics

### 5.1 Analytics Dashboard
A live, visual overview of the entire support operation, including:
- Total conversations handled, escalation rate, and upsell rate
- A 7-day sentiment trend chart
- A breakdown of all emotions detected across conversations
- Distribution of actions taken (Escalate / Normal / Upsell)
- Hourly activity patterns to identify peak support hours
- AI-generated summaries of the top recurring customer issues
- An overall "Customer Health Score" with trend direction (improving, stable, declining)

**Business value:** Leadership gets an at-a-glance, real-time understanding of support quality and customer sentiment — no manual reporting required.

### 5.2 Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
A full CRM layer built directly on top of the conversation data:
- Automatically creates and updates customer profiles from chat, email, and voice interactions
- Tracks each customer's status (Lead, Prospect, Customer, Churned)
- Calculates an AI-generated **risk score** indicating likelihood of churn, with a plain-language explanation of why
- Maintains a complete activity timeline per customer — every conversation, ticket, and email, all in one place
- Supports a full deal pipeline (Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Won/Lost) with drag-and-drop stage management
- Generates AI-written customer summaries on demand, describing relationship history and recommending next actions

**Business value:** Sales and support data live in one system. No customer's history is siloed across separate tools, and every account has a live, AI-assessed risk profile.

### 5.3 Predictive Analytics
Forward-looking intelligence that anticipates problems and opportunities before they happen:
- **Churn risk prediction** — identifies specific customers likely to leave, with the reasons why and recommended interventions
- **Upsell opportunity detection** — surfaces customers in a positive enough state to receive and accept a new offer, along with a suggested offer and ideal contact time
- **Ticket volume forecasting** — predicts how many support tickets are expected over the next seven days, helping teams plan staffing
- **Revenue forecasting** — projects expected revenue over 30, 60, and 90-day horizons based on the current sales pipeline
- **AI strategic recommendations** — a running list of specific, actionable insights (e.g., "3 customers haven't been contacted in over a week — reach out before they churn")

**Business value:** The business moves from reacting to customer problems to preventing them, and from guessing at revenue to forecasting it with data.

### 5.4 Excel Integration
Full two-way spreadsheet support:
- **Import** customer lists, past conversations, tickets, or deal data directly from Excel or CSV files, with automatic column detection
- **Export** any dataset — customers, conversations, tickets, or a complete multi-sheet analytics report — as a professionally formatted Excel file
- Downloadable blank templates for customers, tickets, and deals to standardize data entry
- Import history log so any import can be reviewed or undone

**Business value:** SentimentAI fits into existing business workflows instead of replacing them — teams that rely on spreadsheets can bring their data in and take insights back out effortlessly.

## 6. Language & Accessibility

### 6.1 Bilingual Interface
The entire dashboard interface is available in both English and Hindi, with all labels, buttons, and system messages fully translated — not just the AI's replies.

### 6.2 Regional Language Understanding
Beyond the interface, the AI itself can detect and respond in multiple Indian languages and dialects, including Hindi, Hinglish, and other regional languages, matching the script and tone the customer used.

**Business value:** Support is genuinely accessible to India's linguistically diverse customer base, not limited to English-only interactions.

## 7. Platform Experience

- **Live, always-connected dashboard** — a persistent WebSocket connection means the entire interface updates in real time, with a visible connection status indicator at all times.
- **Dark, focused interface design** — built for support agents and managers who spend hours in the dashboard daily.
- **Fully responsive** — usable on both desktop monitors and mobile devices.
- **Modular architecture** — every feature (Chat, Voice, Email, CRM, Tickets, Analytics, Predictions, Agent Console, Knowledge Base, Excel) operates as its own module within a single, unified dashboard, so features can be extended independently without disrupting the rest of the system.
